# Infomaniak dynamic DNS IP updater

Automatically update your Infomaniak DynDNS service with this script.

## Setup
- Clone the repo or download the script
- Install the required packages (`requests` and `dotenv`)
- Execute the script

The idea is to use a cron-like service to execute the `script.py` python script.
